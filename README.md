This repository is to share my workings as a Web Developer Intern in the Virtual Internship Program (VIP) at LetsGrowMore.

I would like to thank Aman Kesarwani Sir and the team of LetsGrowMore Community for giving me this opportunity to enhance my skills and work on such an amazing projects.

TASK1-

A TODO LIST WEBAPP
Develop a basic To-Do app that enables a user to add daily tasks.

The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible.
Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.
You can also add a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion.
In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list.
Irrespective of the list, a user must be able to delete or edit tasks from it.
